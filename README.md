# Binary-Coded-Genetic-Algorithm


Developed MATLAB codes to solve for an optimization problem using
binary-coded Genetic algorithm, using Roullette-wheel reproduction scheme, two-point crossover 
and bit-wise mutation


Takes in the following as inputs:
1. Number of generations
2. Population size
3. Crossover Probability
4. Mutation Probability


'decode', 'func' and 'realxvalue' are MATLAB functions used by the 'Main' MATLAB file
